# APT Staking Guide

Stake your APT tokens with UrStake to earn rewards while maintaining liquidity through stAPT tokens.

## Overview

APT staking on UrStake allows you to:

- **Earn 8.00%+ APY** on your APT holdings
- **Receive stAPT** liquid staking tokens
- **Trade anytime** without unstaking delays
- **Auto-compound** rewards for maximum yield

## How APT Staking Works

### 1. Deposit APT

When you stake APT with UrStake:

- Your APT is deposited into our smart contract
- The contract delegates your APT to high-performing validators
- You receive stAPT tokens representing your staked position

### 2. Earn Rewards

- Validators earn staking rewards on your behalf
- Rewards are automatically compounded into your position
- Your stAPT token value increases over time

### 3. Maintain Liquidity

- Trade stAPT on DEXs anytime
- Use stAPT in other DeFi protocols
- No waiting periods for access to value

## Step-by-Step Staking

### Prerequisites

- APT tokens in your wallet
- At least 0.1 APT for gas fees
- Connected Aptos wallet

### Staking Process

1. **Visit Staking Interface**

   - Go to [urstake.vercel.app](https://urstake.vercel.app)
   - Navigate to "Stake" ‚Üí "APT"

2. **Enter Stake Amount**

   - Input desired APT amount
   - Review exchange rate (1 APT = ~1 stAPT initially)
   - Check estimated rewards

3. **Confirm Transaction**

   - Click "Stake APT"
   - Review transaction details
   - Approve in your wallet

4. **Receive stAPT**
   - Transaction confirms on-chain
   - stAPT tokens appear in your wallet
   - Start earning rewards immediately

## Understanding stAPT

### Value Accrual

- stAPT value increases as rewards compound
- Exchange rate: stAPT ‚Üí APT improves over time
- No additional transactions needed for compounding

### Trading stAPT

- **DEX Trading**: Swap stAPT for APT or other tokens
- **DeFi Usage**: Use stAPT as collateral or in yield farms
- **Portfolio Management**: Maintain exposure while staying liquid

### Current Metrics

| Metric          | Value              |
| --------------- | ------------------ |
| Current APY     | 8.00%+             |
| Exchange Rate   | 1 stAPT = 1.05 APT |
| Total Staked    | 2.5M APT           |
| Validator Count | 100+               |

## Rewards & Compounding

### Automatic Compounding

- Rewards are reinvested without user action
- Compound frequency: Daily
- No additional gas fees for compounding
- Maximizes long-term returns

### Reward Sources

1. **Validator Rewards**: Base staking rewards from the network
2. **MEV Rewards**: Maximal Extractable Value from block production
3. **Commission Optimization**: Dynamic validator selection

### Yield Calculation

```
Annual Yield = (Validator Rewards + MEV + Optimization) - Protocol Fee
Current APY = 8.00% (net of all fees)
```

## Advanced Features

### Validator Selection

UrStake optimizes validator selection based on:

- **Performance History**: Consistent block production
- **Commission Rates**: Competitive fee structures
- **Decentralization**: Supporting network health
- **Governance**: Active ecosystem participation

### Risk Management

- **Diversification**: Stakes distributed across multiple validators
- **Monitoring**: 24/7 validator performance tracking
- **Rebalancing**: Automatic stake redistribution
- **Slashing Protection**: Insurance against validator penalties

## Fees & Costs

### Protocol Fees

- **Staking Fee**: 0% (no fee to stake)
- **Performance Fee**: 10% of rewards earned
- **Unstaking Fee**: 0% (no fee to unstake)
- **Gas Costs**: Standard Aptos network fees

### Fee Examples

```
Stake 100 APT ‚Üí Receive ~100 stAPT (no fee)
Earn 8 APT rewards ‚Üí Protocol keeps 0.8 APT
Your net gain: 7.2 APT (7.2% effective APY)
```

## Risk Considerations

### Smart Contract Risk

- **Audits**: Multiple security audits completed
- **Insurance**: Protocol insurance available
- **Open Source**: Code publicly verifiable

### Validator Risk

- **Slashing**: Potential penalty for validator misbehavior
- **Downtime**: Temporary reward reduction
- **Mitigation**: Diversified validator set

### Market Risk

- **APT Price**: stAPT value moves with APT price
- **Liquidity**: stAPT/APT trading pair depth
- **Depegging**: Temporary price differences

## Unstaking Options

### Instant Unstaking

- **Via DEX**: Trade stAPT for APT immediately
- **Slippage**: May incur small trading costs
- **Liquidity**: Depends on DEX pool depth

### Direct Unstaking

- **Protocol Unstaking**: Exchange stAPT for APT directly
- **Processing Time**: 7-day unbonding period
- **No Slippage**: Receive exact exchange rate

## Best Practices

### üéØ **Staking Strategy**

- Start with smaller amounts to learn
- Consider dollar-cost averaging for large stakes
- Monitor validator performance regularly
- Keep some APT liquid for gas fees

### üìä **Portfolio Management**

- Diversify across different assets (APT + USDC)
- Use stAPT in DeFi protocols for additional yield
- Monitor exchange rate trends
- Rebalance based on market conditions

### ‚è∞ **Timing Considerations**

- Compound effects increase over time
- Market cycles affect optimal entry/exit
- Validator rewards vary by epoch
- Gas costs fluctuate with network usage

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Transaction Failed**

- Check APT balance for gas fees
- Verify network connection
- Try higher gas limit

**stAPT Not Showing**

- Add stAPT token to wallet
- Check transaction confirmation
- Refresh wallet interface

**Low Rewards**

- Rewards compound over time
- Check validator performance
- Market conditions affect yields
