## Unstaking Strategies

### üéØ **Timing Optimization**

**Market-Based Timing**:

- **Premium Trading**: Trade when stTokens trade at premium
- **Discount Buying**: Buy stTokens when at discount
- **Volume Analysis**: Trade during high-liquidity periods

**Protocol-Based Timing**:

- **Epoch Timing**: APT unstaking optimal at epoch end
- **Rebalancing**: Avoid during strategy rebalancing
- **High Volume**: Expect delays during market stress

### üìä **Partial Unstaking**

**Graduated Approach**:

```javascript
// Example: Unstake 25% every month
const totalPosition = 1000; // stAPT
const monthlyUnstake = totalPosition * 0.25;

Month 1: Unstake 250 stAPT (750 remaining)
Month 2: Unstake 250 stAPT (500 remaining)
Month 3: Unstake 250 stAPT (250 remaining)
Month 4: Unstake 250 stAPT (0 remaining)
```

**Benefits**:

- **Risk Management**: Reduce timing risk
- **Flexibility**: Maintain some earning position
- **Market Adaptation**: Respond to changing conditions

### üí∞ **Tax-Optimized Unstaking**

**FIFO Method** (First In, First Out):

- Unstake oldest positions first
- May optimize for long-term capital gains
- Track acquisition dates carefully

**Tax-Loss Harvesting**:

- Realize losses in down markets
- Offset gains with strategic timing
- Consult tax professionals
